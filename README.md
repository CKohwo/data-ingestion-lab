# Data Intelligence Ingestion Lab

This repository documents the evolution of a foundational **Data Ingestion Engine**,  
starting from a single-page scraper and scaling into a modular, automated, and API-integrated ingestion system. 

Each level represents a new layer of capability — reflecting my personal evolution in  
data engineering, automation, and intelligent systems design.

This repository is a progressive laboratory for building, refining, and mastering **web intelligence systems** — designed to evolve from simple HTML scrapers into fully automated, multi-layer data ingestion architectures.

Each level represents a **functional evolution** — where logic, automation, and scalability compound to form reusable intelligence pipelines.

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy

Each phase is a reflection of deeper system design thinking:

**Level**	**Version**	**Description**
- Level 1 -	v1.0 -	Single-page web scraper (static extraction)
- Level 2 -	v2.0 -	Multi-page crawler (pagination & traversal)
- Level 3	- v3.0 -	Automated ingestion cycles (scheduled data refresh)
- Level 4	- v4.0 -	Hybrid ingestion (Scraping + APIs)
- Level 5	- v5.0 -	Full orchestration (autonomous ingestion engine)

This structure mirrors the way intelligent systems evolve: from reactive scripts to self-sustaining data organisms.
