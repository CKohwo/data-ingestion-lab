# Data Intelligence Ingestion Lab

This repository documents the evolution of a foundational **Data Ingestion Engine**,  
starting from a single-page scraper and scaling into a modular, automated, and API-integrated ingestion system. 

Each level represents a new layer of capability — reflecting my personal evolution in  
data engineering, automation, and intelligent systems design.

This repository is a progressive laboratory for building, refining, and mastering **web intelligence systems** — designed to evolve from simple HTML scrapers into fully automated, multi-layer data ingestion architectures.

Each level represents a **functional evolution** — where logic, automation, and scalability compound to form reusable intelligence pipelines.

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy

Each phase is a reflection of deeper system design thinking:
- **Level 1** → Static extraction (single-page comprehension)
- **Level 2** → Multi-page crawling (system traversal)
- **Level 3** → Automation cycles (time-aware data refresh)
- **Level 4** → Hybridization (API + Scraping integration)
- **Level 5** → Full orchestration (autonomous data ingestion)

This structure mirrors the way intelligent systems evolve: from reactive scripts to self-sustaining data organisms.
