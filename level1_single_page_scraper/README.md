# Level 1 ‚Äî Static Web Scraper (Jumia website reference)

This Level 1 phase introduces the foundational layer of **web intelligence ingestion** ‚Äî a **single-page static web scraper** designed to extract structured information from the Jumia laptops category.

It uses **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** to capture key product attributes such as:
- Laptop name  
- Price  
- Ratings  
- Product link  

and exports them into a structured **CSV dataset** for downstream processing.
